# Options Pricing + Volatility Surface Exploration
This repository is my personal investigation into implied volatility surfaces of options chains. Here, I include my notebook code exercises as well as a list of the literature I use in my calculations.

Inspiration for this project came from the amazing book "Mathematical Modeling and Computation in Finance: With Exercises and Python and MATLAB Computer Codes", by Kees Oosterlee and Lech A. Grzelak. This book is amazing!
